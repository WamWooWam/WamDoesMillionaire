# Wam does Millionaire

This is the source code repository for my clone of Who Wants to be a Millionaire that I streamed on Twitch between the 21st-30th of January 2022!

This code is public for historical and archive purposes, and I have no plan to clean it up. It was built over the course of less than a month with the goal of making something functional using skills I already had. It is not "good code".

For obvious reasons, copyrighted music and sound effects are not included in this repository, if you wanted to use this code for some reason, you would need to source that yourself or remove that functionality.
